I knew I was wasting my time.  
Keep myself awake at night.  
'Cause whenever I close my eyes.  
I'm chasing your tail lights.  
In the dark.  
In the dark.  
In the dark.

Watched you said nothing, said nothing, said nothing.  
I can't think of anyone, anyone else.  
I can't think of anyone, anyone else.  
I can't think of anyone, anyone else.  
I won't think of anyone else.
