On a jet plane sailing through the night  
I find I’m thinking of you  
9 years ago was just like yesterday  

On a jet plane sailing through the night  
I guess I’m wasting precious time  
Seven years ago you told me you had plans to go

This jet plane lands silently still  
Can’t believe I’ll be there soon  
Three years ago felt like a lifetime
