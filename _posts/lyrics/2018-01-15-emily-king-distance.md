It makes the leaves on the trees fall  
It makes the hours in the day long  
Makes me wanna clear my head  
Find a little cafe and write the words to a song

When we are apart  
Distance makes the heart grow  
Even when Iâ€™m lonely  
Happy knowing that your love is never far

In the light or in the dark  
On a plane up in the stars  
In a movie or at the bar  
Home alone or out to tea

We get together we make it good
