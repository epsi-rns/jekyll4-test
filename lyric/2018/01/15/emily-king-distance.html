      <h2>Emily King - Distance</h2>
  <pre>January 15, 2018</pre>

  <p>It makes the leaves on the trees fall<br />
It makes the hours in the day long<br />
Makes me wanna clear my head<br />
Find a little cafe and write the words to a song</p>

<p>When we are apart<br />
Distance makes the heart grow<br />
Even when Iâ€™m lonely<br />
Happy knowing that your love is never far</p>

<p>In the light or in the dark<br />
On a plane up in the stars<br />
In a movie or at the bar<br />
Home alone or out to tea</p>

<p>We get together we make it good</p>
