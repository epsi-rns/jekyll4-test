      <h2>Surviving White Winter</h2>
  <pre>January 01, 2016</pre>

  <p>It was a frozen winter in cold war era.
We were two lazy men, a sleepy boy, two long haired women,
a husky with attitude, and two shotguns.
After three weeks, we finally configure javascript.</p>

<p>But we lost our beloved husky before we finally made it.
Now, every january, we remember our husky,
that helped all of us to survive.</p>
