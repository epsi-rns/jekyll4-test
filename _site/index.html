      <h2>Your mission. Good Luck!</h2>

  <p>To have, to hold, to love,
cherish, honor, and protect?</p>

<p>To shield from terrors known and unknown?
To lie, to deceive?</p>

<p>To live a double life,
to fail to prevent her abduction,
erase her identity, 
force her into hiding,
take away all she has known.</p>
